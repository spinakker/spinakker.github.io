# Personal blog

This is my personal blog/site generated with Jekyll now.

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

**Jekyll Now** makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup. You can get it [here](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
